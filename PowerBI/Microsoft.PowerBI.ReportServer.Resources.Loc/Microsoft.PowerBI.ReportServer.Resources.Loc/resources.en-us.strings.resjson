Brainstorming ideas for questions you can ask on your data (`/brainstorm`)\n\n2. Generating SQL from your instructions (`/generate-sql [instructions]`)\n\n3. Explaining and fixing SQL queries (`/explain` and `/fix [what to fix]`)\n\n4. Asking questions and getting help (`/question [question]` and `/help` to see this message)\n\n**Tips:**\n\n> Copilot is best when you're specific!\n\nCopilot never sees your data values (only schema), so the more specific you are, the more helpful suggestions will be. In the chat, you can describe your goal and let Copilot figure out how best to help you, or use one of the `/commands` listed above.\n\nSome commands (like `/fix [what to fix]` and `/explain`) can be invoked via buttons in the ribbon.\n\nIn the query editor, as you type, Copilot will suggest completions for your SQL queries. You can accept these suggestions by pressing the `Tab` key.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n> We want to hear from you!\n\nIf you have any ideas for Copilot, [submit them here](https://ideas.fabric.microsoft.com)!\n",
